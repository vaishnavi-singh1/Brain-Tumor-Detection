# Brain-Tumor-Detection

## Objective
Develop an automated system for brain tumor classification as benign or malignant.

## Methodology
This project combines machine learning and image processing techniques to achieve accurate tumor classification.

- **Noise Removal**: Utilizes adaptive median filtering.
- **Segmentation**: Implements Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering to identify regions of interest.
- **Feature Extraction**: Employs Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) for extracting tumor characteristics.
- **Classification**: Utilizes classification algorithms for tumor categorization.

## Workflow
1. **Noise Removal**: Adaptive median filtering for noise reduction.
2. **Segmentation**: GMM clustering for identifying tumor regions.
3. **Feature Extraction**: GLCM for extracting tumor features.
4. **Classification**: Algorithms to determine tumor malignancy.
